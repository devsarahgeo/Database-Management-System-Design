# 🍇 Database-Management-System-Design for Napa Valley Wineries

Napa Valley Wineries are globally renowned for their vineyards and premium wine production.  
This project designs and implements a **Database Management System (DBMS)** to manage critical winery operations, including:

- 🍇 Vineyard & grape management  
- 🍷 Wine production & inventory  
- 🏠 Cellar tracking  
- 💰 Financial management & compliance  
- 📦 Sales, distribution, and wine club memberships  
- 📊 Data analytics & reporting

## 🚀 What I Did

### 1. Business Understanding  
- Collected requirements by asking the right questions to capture winery operations and challenges.

### 2. Entity & Relationship Analysis  
- Identified key entities and mapped possible relationships between them.

### 3. Database Design  
- Built an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** with **cardinality**.  
- Converted the ERD into a **Logical Relational Model**:
  - Introduced **bridge tables** for many-to-many (M:N) relationships.  
  - Ensured **Entity Integrity** and **Referential Integrity**.  
  - Created a **Data Dictionary** to define table schema before writing queries.  

### 4. Normalization  
- Organized data into **normalized tables** to reduce redundancy and improve consistency.

### 5. Implementation  
- Created **SQL tables**, inserted **sample records**, and executed queries for winery business cases.  
- Used **MS Access** to visualize relationships and design schema.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
- **SQL** (DDL, DML)  
- **MS Access** (schema & relationship design)  
- **Database Design Principles** (ERD, Normalization, Integrity constraints)  

---

## 📈 Key Learning Outcomes
- Structured approach to **database design** from **requirements → ERD → Logical Model → Implementation**.  
- Hands-on experience with **normalization**, **referential integrity**, and **schema design**.  
- Ability to translate **complex business needs** into a **scalable DBMS**.
