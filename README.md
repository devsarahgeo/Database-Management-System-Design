# Database-Management-System-Design
Database Management System for Napa Valley Wineries

Napa Valley Wineries are globally renowned for their vineyards and premium wine production. This project focuses on designing and implementing a Database Management System (DBMS) to manage critical winery operations, including:

- Vineyard & grape management

- Wine production & inventory

- Cellar tracking

- Financial management & compliance

- Sales, distribution, and wine club memberships

- Data analytics & reporting

🚀 What I Did

**Business Understanding**

- Collected requirements by asking the right questions to capture winery operations and challenges.

**Entity & Relationship Analysis**

- Identified key entities and mapped possible relationships between them.

**Database Design**
- Built an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) with cardinality.

- Converted the ERD into a Logical Relational Model:

  - Introduced bridge tables for many-to-many (m:n) relationships.

  - Ensured Entity Integrity and Referential Integrity.

  - Created a Data Dictionary to define table schema before writing queries.

**Normalization**
- Organized data into normalized tables to reduce redundancy and improve consistency.

**Implementation**
- Created SQL tables, inserted sample records, and executed queries for winery business cases.

- Used MS Access to visualize relationships and design schema.

**🛠️ Tools & Skills**

- SQL (DDL, DML)

- MS Access (for schema & relationship design)

- Database Design Principles (ERD, Normalization, Integrity constraints)

**📈 Key Learning Outcomes**
- Structured approach to database design from requirements → ERD → Logical Model → Implementation.

- Hands-on experience with normalization, referential integrity, and schema design.

- Ability to translate complex business needs into a scalable DBMS.

👉 This project demonstrates my end-to-end database design skills, blending both business understanding and technical implementation.
